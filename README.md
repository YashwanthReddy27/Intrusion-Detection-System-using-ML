## Dataset
The dataset used is KDD Test and Train dataset taken from kaggle. The reason behind choosing this dataset is it does not include redundant data in training set making the classifier more robust and at the same time it does not have duplicate records in the testing set.
It contains 42 columns last being the target column in which 1 defines attack and 0 defines no attack.


## Method 
Six models have been implemented namely Decision Tree, Random Forest classifier, Support Vector Machines, Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multi Layer perceptron.
